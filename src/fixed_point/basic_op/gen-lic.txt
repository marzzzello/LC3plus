   This "General Public License" is published in the Annex 1 of the
   ITU-T Recommendation on "SOFTWARE TOOLS FOR HOMOGENITY OF RESULTS
   IN THE STANDARDIZATION PROCESS OF SPEECH AND AUDIO CODERS",
   approved in Geneva, 2000.


   TERMS AND CONDITIONS

   1. This License Agreement applies to any module or other work
   related to the ITU-T Software Tool Library, and developed by the
   User's Group on Software Tools. The "Module", below, refers to any
   such module or work, and a "work based on the Module" means either
   the Module or any work containing the Module or a portion of it,
   either verbatim or with modifications.  Each licensee is addressed
   as "you".

   2. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Module's
   source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you:
   -	conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate
      copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty;
   -  keep intact all the notices that refer to this General Public
      License and to the absence of any warranty; and
   -  give any other recipients of the Module a copy of this General
      Public License along with the Module.
   You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy.

   3. You may modify your copy or copies of the Module or any portion
   of it, and copy and distribute such modifications under the terms
   of Paragraph 1 above, provided that you also do the following:

       o  cause the modified files to carry prominent notices stating
       that you changed the files and the date of any change; and

       o  cause the whole of any work that you distribute or publish,
       that in whole or in part contains the Module or any part
       thereof, either with or without modifications, to be licensed
       at no charge to all third parties under the terms of this
       General Public License (except that you may choose to grant
       warranty protection to some or all third parties, at your
       option).

       o  If the modified module normally reads commands interactively
       when run, you must cause it, when started running for such
       interactive use in the simplest and most usual way, to print or
       display an announcement including an appropriate copyright
       notice and a notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying
       that you provide a warranty) and that users may redistribute
       the module under these conditions, and telling the user how to
       view a copy of this General Public License.

   You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy,
   and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange
   for a fee.

   Mere aggregation of another independent work with the Module (or
   its derivative) on a volume of a storage or distribution medium
   does not bring the other work under the scope of these terms.

   4.  You may copy and distribute the Module (or a portion or
   derivative of it, under Paragraph 2) in object code or executable
   form under the terms of Paragraphs 1 and 2 above provided that you
   also do one of the following:

       o  accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-
       readable source code, which must be distributed under the terms
       of Paragraphs 1 and 2 above; or,

       o  accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three
       years, to give any third party free (except for a nominal
       charge for the cost of distribution) a complete machine-
       readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be
       distributed under the terms of Paragraphs 1 and 2 above; or,

       o  accompany it with the information you received as to where
       the corresponding source code may be obtained.  (This
       alternative is allowed only for noncommercial distribution and
       only if you received the module in object code or executable
       form alone.) 

   Source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for
   making modifications to it.  For an executable file, complete
   source code means all the source code for all modules it contains;
   but, as a special exception, it need not include source code for
   modules which are standard libraries that accompany the operating
   system on which the executable file runs, or for standard header
   files or definitions files that accompany that operating system.

   5.  You may not copy, modify, sublicense, distribute or transfer
   the Module except as expressly provided under this General Public
   License. Any attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense,
   distribute or transfer the Module is void, and will automatically
   terminate your rights to use the Module under this License. 
   However, parties who have received copies, or rights to use copies,
   from you under this General Public License will not have their
   licenses terminated so long as such parties remain in full
   compliance.

   6.  By copying, distributing or modifying the Module (or any work
   based on the Module) you indicate your acceptance of this license
   to do so, and all its terms and conditions.

   7.  Each time you redistribute the Module (or any work based on the
   Module), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
   original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Module subject
   to these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further
   restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted
   herein.

   8.  The ITU-T may publish revised and/or new versions of this
   General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will
   be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in
   detail to address new problems or concerns.

   Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the
   Module specifies a version number of the license which applies to
   it and "any later version", you have the option of following the
   terms and conditions either of that version or of any later version
   published by the ITU-T. If the Module does not specify a version
   number of the license, you may choose any version ever published by
   the ITU-T.

   9.  If you wish to incorporate parts of the Module into other free
   modules whose distribution conditions are different, write to the
   author to ask for permission.  For software which is copyrighted by
   the ITU-T, write to the ITU-T Secretariat; exceptions may be made
   for this. This decision will be guided by the two goals of
   preserving the free status of all derivatives of this free software
   and of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.


   NO WARRANTY

   10. BECAUSE THE MODULE IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO
   WARRANTY FOR THE MODULE, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. 
   EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS
   AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE MODULE "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF
   ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED
   TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A
   PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND
   PERFORMANCE OF THE MODULE IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE MODULE PROVE
   DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR
   OR CORRECTION.

   11. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN
   WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY
   MODIFY AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE MODULE AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE
   TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR
   CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE
   THE MODULE (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING
   RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR
   A FAILURE OF THE MODULE TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER MODULES), EVEN IF
   SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF
   SUCH DAMAGES.

   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
